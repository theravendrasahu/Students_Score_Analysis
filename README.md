📊 Students Score Analysis
📌 Summary
This notebook analyzes students' scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, exploring various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and study habits. Key insights were derived using data visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib) and statistical analysis (Pandas, NumPy).

🔍 Key Findings
Gender Distribution

The dataset contains more female students than male students.
Gender-based score comparison shows slight variation, but no drastic differences.
Parental Education Impact

Students whose parents have a higher level of education tend to score better in all subjects.
There is a positive correlation between parental education and student performance.
Effect of Test Preparation

Students who completed a test preparation course performed better in all three subjects.
Suggests structured preparation programs help improve scores.
Lunch Type Influence

Students with standard lunches scored higher compared to those on free/reduced lunch.
Indicates a potential link between nutrition and academic performance.
Study Hours vs. Scores

Students who studied more than 5 hours a week had higher scores.
However, the correlation is not strictly linear—other factors might contribute.
Parental Marital Status

Has negligible impact on student scores, meaning family structure alone is not a strong predictor of performance.
Missing Data

Several fields like Ethnic Group, Test Preparation, and Transport Means have missing values, requiring data cleaning before deeper analysis.
📌 Recommendations
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values using imputation or removal, especially in Ethnic Group, Test Prep, and Transport Means.
Convert categorical variables into numerical representations for advanced analysis.
📈 Further Analysis
Regression Analysis: Use ML models to predict student scores based on given features.
Correlation Study: Quantify the exact relationship between parent education, lunch type, and scores.
🎯 Practical Recommendations for Schools
Encourage Test Preparation: Implement structured pre-exam programs to improve student performance.
Improve Nutritional Programs: Ensure students on free/reduced lunch receive adequate nutritional support.
Parental Engagement: Encourage parental involvement in education to improve student outcomes.
